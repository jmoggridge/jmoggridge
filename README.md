### Hi ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jason A. Moggridge


I'm a programmer and data analyst mostly working on biomedical research.
Find my [homepage / blog here](https://jmoggridge.com) or my (probably very outdated) [CV here](https://jmoggridge.github.io).


These are some projects I'm working on (currently or recently):  
- [CUBE: Coronavirus in the Urban Built Environment](https://cube-ontario.github.io/)
- [jrnowl: helps you prepare medical research manuscripts for publication](https://jrnowl.com)
- [GLP1-rx.com](GLP1-rx.com) and [SGLT2rx.com](SGLT2rx.com) inform patients and providers about the benefits of novel diabetes drugs.


These are some talks / slideshows / educational materials that I created:  
- [Fixed and random effects models in meta-analysis]([https://jmoggridge.github.io/](https://jmoggridge.github.io/fixed-and-random-effects)
- [Leading and lagging variables demo](https://jmoggridge.github.io/leader-or-lagger)


I'm currently learning web development. Here are some silly websites that I made:
- [Get random dog pictures](https://jmoggridge.github.io/frontendmasters/intro-to-web/dog/)
- [You don't know JSm](https://jmoggridge.github.io/frontendmasters/js-first-steps-to-pro/quizgame)
